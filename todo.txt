DONE
- Practice rounds, “Example” should be replaced by “Practice round x of X” and this should be left-aligned.
- COUNTING, Switch font size of the two lines described above. So “please choose your preferred allocation appears bigger’.
- COUNTING, “Choose your preferred budget” should write instead “Please choose your preferred allocation!” and this also should be left-aligned.
- COUNTING, Replace “Good X” and “Good Y” by “X” and “Y”, respectively.
- Number of rounds is not working, they cannot be implemented. Regardless of what one chooses, one gets 50 rounds
- Screen 1, Replace “First, and example” with “ To familiarize yourself with the graphical interface, you can now practice for X (Variable # practice rounds) rounds. At the end of the X rounds, one will be
randomly selected. For each Token earned you will receive Y (Variable # exchange rate practice rounds) Euros in cash at the end of the experimenT
- COUNTING, “This site says…” should be erased.
- COUNTING, The second sentence should be replaced by “Your chosen allocation is X=… and Y=… . (begin new line) Do you want to confirm this allocation? (buttons should be “Yes” “No”).
- INSTRUCTIONS, Part A (always the second appearing to subjects regardless of whether this is the individual decision making part or the group decision making part)
- INSTRUCTIONS, You will now make decisions in the X (variable number of decisions individual level or group level) rounds of Part A as described in the instructions.
- INSTRUCTIONS, Part B (always the third appearing to subjects regardless of whether this is the individual decision making part or the group decision making part)
- COUNTING, “Decision x of X” should be replaced by “Part B: Round x of X” and this should be left-aligned.
- GROUP DECISION, middle-bottom right panel, “Allocation” should be changed to “Division”
- GROUP DECISION, top right panel, “My budget proposal” should be changed to “My allocation proposal”
- GROUP DECISION, middle-top right panel, “Partner’s budget proposal” should be changed to “Other’s allocation proposal”
- GROUP DECISION, top left window, “Choose your preferred budget” should write instead “Please choose your preferred allocation and division!” and this also should be left-aligned.
- GROUP DECISION, First decision in each round of the group part is not independent. What happens now is that as soon as someone makes a decision, this decision appears on the other’s player screen. We want that both members of the group make the first decision in each round without knowing what
the other did. After the first decision in each round subjects can see in real time what the other does.
- GROUP DECISION, middle right panel, “My allocation proposal” should be changed to “My proposed division”
- GROUP DECISION, Chat is not working properly. There is a delay, when a message is sent, it takes a while before it appears on the other’s screen.
- There is a bug in the slider. First time you click it does not work, after click it many times it responds.
NOTE: Not an issue in Google Chrome. From your screenshots, it appears you were testing in Microsoft Edge. Please use Chrome only for testing and experiment.
- GROUP DECISION, bottom-left panel, Chat window should extend over the entire width of the interface
- Legend (below second slider) blue line segment followed by blue text: “Other’s division proposal”
- The message “Status.(new line) Budget proposals DO (NOT) match” should be changed to “Status. (new line) Allocations proposals DO (NOT) match” , should be in bold, and should
appear to the right of the two lines “Decision x of X” and “ Choose preferred allocation, that is on top of the left-top panel.
- GROUP DECISION, It is difficult to match proposals, this has to do with the sensitivity of the mouse. To ease this it would be good that when the subject is in some neighborhood of what the other chose, say an interval of 0.3 each side, then that allocation can be chosen.
- Add a new feature: 6 pre-specified treatments as we discussed before.
- Button “Next decision” not necessary. As soon as groups make a match they can go to the next round. When allocation decisions and division decisions need to be made, then as soon as one of these decisions have a match they should go opaque and the other decision is still active until a match for that decision is made.
- Get rid of the “Next decision” button. As soon as allocation proposals match, a pop-up window should appear saying “Your allocation proposals match. A new round will start. (OK button)”
- GROUP DECISION, After making a choice, the black dot goes to a random point on the budget line. We do not want that, we want that the dot stays were the previous choice was made before the subject moves the mouse inside the graphical interface. 

CHECK
- Add a new feature: Payment of the practice round (yes/no).
- Add a new feature: set exchange rate of the practice round (default is the same exchange rate as the exchange rate of the other parts of the experiment).
- Add a new feature: number of decisions to be paid (default one for each part)
- Add a new feature: adjust the scale of the graphic interface (choice of the allocation) to the maximum tokens that can be attained. Note that the maximum can be either 200 tokens,
100 tokens, or anything in between, depeding on the treatment. Alternatively no adjustment and the scale is 200 on each axis.
- Before they both make the first division choice, the sliders should not show any dark gray and the messages above, My share of the eventually agreed X (or Y), should write: ””
- When a choice is made, a pop-up should appear and should write “Your chosen division is X=… and Y=… . (begin new line) Do you want to confirm this allocation? (buttons should be “Yes” “No”).”
- As with the allocation decision, the first division decision should be independent. As soon as both players make a first choice, they can see each others division choices.
- GROUP DECISION, The most relevant bug is that sometimes proposals cannot be matched. Matched subjects face different values of Y for a given X.
- The message “Allocation proposals DO (NOT) match” should be changed to “Division proposals DO (NOT) match” , should be in bold, and should appear to the right of the lines “Decision x of X” and “ Choose preferred allocation”, that is on top of the left-top panel.
- Panels not opaque anymore (see why below)
