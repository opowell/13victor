TODO:
Practice rounds
- The budget lines in the practice rounds should have the same properties as those in the
treatment the subject was assigned to. For example, if the subject is assigned to a treatment in
which the maximum amount she/he can allocate to an account is 70 tokens, the budget lines in
the practice rounds should also have that property.
- We would also like to implement practice rounds for the couple’s part task as well. As
mentioned before, the properties of the budget lines and the nature of the task should be
identical to that of the treatment she/he was assigned to. For instance, a subject assigned to the
endogenous treatment sees in the practice rounds an allocation task and a division task.
- In the practice rounds of the couples part, the partner-subject a subject is paired with must be
different from the partner-subject of a subject in the “actual” couples part. In other words,
there is some re-matching of partners after the practice rounds of the couples part are over. For
your understanding, this is what we are telling the subjects in the instructions:
“Now the [60] rounds of Part I will start. For this purpose, you will be matched with another participant in
the room who is di¤erent from the participant you were matched with during the practice rounds of Part
I. You will stay matched with this new other participant for all [60] decision rounds of Part I.”
- The number of practice rounds are the same across parts. So in the experimenter interface
there is no need to generate a new variable that determines the number of practice rounds for
the group part.
Layout
- In the individual part and the group parts please introduce a button so that subjects can check
the instructions of the part they are currently working on.
- For the main panel, e.g. that containing the allocation task, add the title: “Token Allocation”.
Please insert this title to the left of the message Part A/B round x of X, but with bigger and bold
letters.

-
- When a choice is made in the allocation part, the graph is slighlty shifted upwards, can
something be done to avoid that?
