TODO:
Practice rounds
- The budget lines in the practice rounds should have the same properties as those in the
treatment the subject was assigned to. For example, if the subject is assigned to a treatment in
which the maximum amount she/he can allocate to an account is 70 tokens, the budget lines in
the practice rounds should also have that property.
